// Introduction

EMBLEM and R.EMBLEM is a post-quantum cryptographic libary based on (Ring) Learning with Errors ((R)LWE) problem written in C

## Main Features

- Supports IND-CCA secure key encapsulation mechanism.
- Support for Linux OS using GNU GCC.     
- Includes Known Answer Tests (KATs).



## Implementation

OpenSSL must be installed before building EMBLEM and R.EMBLEM

### Instructions for Linux:

- Define parameters by typing '#define xxx' on param.h as given in below ('Parameter Sets')
- Type 

  ```sh
  $ make
  ```

## Parameter Sets
Both EMBLEM and R.EMBLEm paremeters can be configured by editing 'params.h'.
Below are parameter sets used in each folder.
